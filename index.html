                        Cooling Centrifuge is a high speed centrifuge for huge capacity needs. A low temperature centrifuge is used to determine sedimentation velocity, shape and mass of macromolecules, separation of phases, isolate viruses, organelles, membranes and biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and lipoproteins. This can also be used for phase separation of nanomaterials.

                        <br>

                        The cooling centrifuge works on the principle of centrifugation.
Centrifugation is the process of sedimentation of the particles (materials)
present within the container (test tube, buckets, etc. ) using the angular motion. So, it helps
in the separation of particles having different sizes and shapes.
<br>
<br>
When the particle is moving with a certain angular velocity, the particle will
experience a centripetal force towards the center of rotation. In our case, the centripetal
force is due to the upthrust of the fluid media and the electrostatic repulsion due to the
charged particles present on the surfaces
of the sample particles.

<br>
<br>
To balance the inward centripetal force, the pseudo force ( known as
the centrifugal force) acts away from the center. During this process, the particle begins to
move away from the center. This is due
to the inertia of the particles.
Different particles can have different sedimentation rates. A higher sedimentation rate means
that the particle will quickly settle at the base. Thus this helps to separate the particles.

            <li>Centrifugation is a technique that helps to separate mixtures by applying
                centrifugal force. A centrifuge is a device, generally driven by an electric motor, that puts an
                object, e.g., a rotor, in a rotational movement around a fixed axis..</li> <br>
            <li>A centrifuge works by using the principle of sedimentation: Under the influence of
                gravitational force (g-force), substances separate according to their density. Different types
                of separation are known, including isopycnic, ultrafiltration, density gradient, phase
                separation, and pelleting.
                    </li> <br> 
                    
                    <li>  Pelleting is the most common application for centrifuges. Here, particles are concentrated as
                        a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube and separated from the remaining solution,
                        called supernatant</li> <br>

                        <li> During phase separation, chemicals are converted from a matrix or an
                            aqueous medium to a solvent (for additional chemical or molecular biological analysis). In
                            ultrafiltration, macromolecules are purified, separated, and concentrated by using a
                            membrane </li> <br>

                            <li> Isopycnic centrifugation is carried out using a "self-generating" density gradient
                                established through equilibrium sedimentation. This method concentrates the analysis
                                matches with those of the surrounding solution.</li> <br>

                                <li>Protocols for centrifugation typically specify
                                    the relative centrifugal force (rcf) and the degree of acceleration in multiples of g (g-force).
                                    Working with the rotational speed, such as revolutions per minute (rpm), is rather imprecise</li> <br>
